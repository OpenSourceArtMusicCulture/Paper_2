# Paper 2 - Open Source Critical Design Document 

Due Date: Friday, November, 11, 2016, 11:59PM

Minimum Word Count – 7000 Words

Working in teams of 4 to 5, students will collaborate on an assigned project to outline a critical Open Source project/product that addresses the design problem assigned.  (Note: these problems are designed to encourage the student to think outside the bounds of “normal” OS computing and hardware; students may want to read the “QueerOS” reading when beginning the project.)

The design document must address the three major themes of the lecture: the technical, formal, and social dimensions of the proposed software.  What are the technological needs and desires of the project? Where is it sourced from? Who does it impact?  In which ways does it impact them? How is it used? What are the interfaces? How to people communicate with it? About it? Through it? What are the gendered/political/and racial values embedded within the system?

More information about this paper will be give after Paper 1 is due.
